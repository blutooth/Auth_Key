# Auth_Key

To run this Program run main. The program uses behavioural biometric information to detect a given user. This biometric information comes from the timing/pressure of key presses on an iphone screen. On the very limited training data accuracies of 97% Were achieved. 

The write up file https://github.com/blutooth/Auth_Key/blob/master/aimbrain_writeUp.pdf contains a more detailed description of the testing methods. 'Get Data' does most of the preprocessing nd 'auth algorithms' trains the machine learning models which use random forests .
